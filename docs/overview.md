ForwardChain is a compact engine for honest panel time series modeling. I built it from UC Berkeley work and refactored it into a clean repo for hiring managers who value careful validation and interpretability.

Headlines
* Honest forward chaining with five splits
* Safe per entity lag and rolling features
* Gradient boosted tree baseline with small grid search
* Permutation importance and saved figures
* Metrics and figures written to disk

Relevance to markets
Swap Store for Ticker and Sales for a future return target then rerun the same flow. The design encourages honest evaluation and avoids leakage across time which is critical for any live signal.
